### BigQuery Machine Learning Models

This repository contains some examples of how we can build common machine learning / probabilistic models inside BigQuery's resourceful world.

Rationale being: If bq offers scalable compute resources, it can theoretically be utilized to solve a lot of datascience intensive tasks right there in the sql world.


##### Note:

Each model is contained in a singular sql file, along with its documentation. I will add more detailed documentation in the coming days.
