### BigQuery Machine Learning Models

This repository contains some examples of how we can build common machine learning / probabilistic models using BigQuery's resourceful world.

Rationale being: If bq offers potentially "unlimited" compute resources via horizontal scaling, it can theoretically be utilized to solve a lot of data intensive tasks right there [only in the sql world ;-)].

Each model is contained in a singular sql file, along with its documentation. I will add more detailed documentation in the coming days.
